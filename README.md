# Kubernetes

## Prerequsites
A Kubernetes cluster up and running
- Ingress controller or cloud load balancer
- Kubectl configured


## Getting started with the workshop
In the folder docs, you will find two documents. One contains the slides used in the workshop, and the other is the lab workbook. The labbook will guide you through the workshop, step by step.

## Cleanup
When you are done, you can remove Vault and Vault-ui by running the script `delete-workshop.sh`. This will delete the Kubernetes objects from the cluster.

# -workshop files
Some files will have or use a `-workshop` edition. These will setup and tear down the cluster within the scope of the workshop.

We encourage you to try the regular files after the workshop.
